In this assignment, you will solve a series of array manipulation problems using **map**, **filter**, **reduce**, **some**, and **every**. The goal is to practice identifying which of these methods is best suited for a given problem and to implement solutions accordingly. You are free to use any combination of these methods in your solutions. However, when writing your callback functions (e.g., the logic passed into `map`, `filter`, etc.), you must restrict them to only work with the **element** of the arrayâ€”do not use the index or the array reference in your logic.
